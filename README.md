### Tuts+ Tutorial: Creating a Hybrid App Using Polymer and Cordova

#### Instructor: Hathibelagal Ashraff

If you've been tasked with developing an Android app on a very short deadline, developing it using hybrid technologies might be the best thing to do. Though hybrid apps are, in general, slower than their native counterparts, on most mobile devices these days, users won't be able to tell the difference as long as you manage to provide the same look and feel. In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to develop a to-do list hybrid app for Android which largely conforms to Google's material design specification using Polymer, Polymer paper elements and Apache Cordova.
